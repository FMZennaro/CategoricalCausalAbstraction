    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks we have discussed at length abstraction and (interventional) consistency, especially in the framework of [Rischel2020]. We have defined the notion of abstraction and abastraction error (first notebook), examined properties of this definition (second notebook), compared abstractions to transformations from [Rubenstein2017] (third notebook), implemented automated code to compute the abstraction error (fourth notebook), and then reviewed the compositionality of abstraction error from [Rischel2021] (fifth notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "An underlying idea behind these explorations was that the quality of an abstraction could be assessed through a quantitative evaluation of interventional consistency, that is, the requirement that: (i) using a low-level mechanism under intervention and then abstracting; or (ii) abstracting to the intervened high-level model and then using a mechanism; would produce the same result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we take a closer look at interventional consistency, and we explore other forms of consistency. We instantiate a series of models and abstractions to show how observational, interventional and counterfactual consistency are not strictly related to one another.\n",

    "The notebook aims at showing in a succint way the existence of models and abstractions that may guarantee different forms of consistency. We will go through the following steps: \n",
    "- Reviewing the definition and the relevance of consistency (Section 2)\n",
    "- Presenting the approach used to express the consistency problem as a commutativity problem on BNs in $\\mathtt{FinStoch}$ (Section 3)\n",

    "- Listing forms of consistency in the interventional domain (Section 5)\n",

    "# Approach to causal consistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested above we want to consider different forms of consistencies, specifically observational, interventional and counterfactual.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well-known that these three types of quantities live on three layers of a strict hierarchy; each layer is furthermore associated with a mathematical object that allows for the treatment of these quantities. Thus, Bayes networks (BN) deal only with observational quantities; casual Bayes networks enable us to evaluate not only observational quantities, but also interventional quantities; and, finally, structural causal models (SCM) add the possibility of considering counterfactual quantities [Bareinboim2022].\n",
    "\n",
    "Our discussion of causal models started from SCMs [Pearl2009] (see first notebook), but through the simplification of  our models and their embedding in $\\mathtt{FinStoch}$ following the approach of [Rischel2020] (see first notebook again) we dropped enough information that we have been left virtually with a BN or a CBN. If we were working with a CBN we would not be able to discuss counterfactual queries; with a BN we could not even assess an interventional query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach that we have implicitly followed, and which we will make explicit now, is that we are always given a completely defined SCM $\\mathcal{M}^*$ (here we use the star to identify this ground truth SCM and distinguish it from other CBNs or BNs). However, we do not work directly with the SCM $\\mathcal{M}^*$. For us, the SCM is a generator of BNs (or CBNs). For us, in a sense, a SCM is a more expressive object than a CBN or a BN because it is actually a set of CBNs or BNs; it is a set of rules for generating new models.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we will want to consider consistency in the observational domain, we will take our SCM $\\mathcal{M}^*$ and extract from it the base BN $\\mathcal{M}$. If we will want to consider consistency in the interventional domain, and thus work with an intervention $\\iota$, we will extract from $\\mathcal{M}^*$ the model $\\mathcal{M}_\\iota$ which, after edge removal and structrual function replacement, is again a BN. If we want to consider consistency in the counterfactual domain, assuming we have performed an intervention $\\iota$ and now we want to observe the effects had we performed $\\bar{\\iota}$, we will extract from $\\mathcal{M}^*$ the model $\\mathcal{M}_{\\iota\\bar{\\iota}}$ which, after factual intervention, abduction on the exogenous variables and counterfactual intervention [Pearl2009], provides us with a BN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime we will have to evaluate one form of consistency (marginal, joint, conditional) we will therefore just evaluate it in the relative BN assuming it can be represented in $\\mathtt{FinStoch}$ and that commutativity is well-defined. "

    "In this notebook we have formally reviewed different forms of consistency that may hold between a base and an abstracted model. We have analyzed consistencies according to the model on which they are evaluated (observational, interventional, counterfactual) and the distributions we were interested into (marginal, joint, conditional). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach has been to always reduce our SCM model to a simple Bayes networks which we could embed in $\\mathtt{FinStoch}$ and on which we could evaluate commutativity. This meant that interventions and counterfactual statements were used to generate the corresponding Bayes network from the given SCM. This has allowed us to easily work with very different (and possibly convoluted) interventional or counterfactual statements, while, at the same time, always evaluating consistency on simple diagrams. The ensuing simulations showed how SCMs related via abstractions may guarantee different forms of consistency."
