    "# Automating Abstraction Error\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring the idea of abstraction [1] and transformation [2] in the first three notebooks, we now focus on the more practical problem of how, given two SCMs and an abstraction between them, we can compute the abstraction error between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will develop code to compute exactly the abstraction error as defined in [1] and in the previous notebook. To achieve our goal, we will write functions that will be dependant on the metric we want to adopt and on the set of nodes over which we will evaluate the abstraction error. We will present a series of implementation progressively considering richer sets over which to compute the abstraction error.\n",

    "This notebook was developed in order to offer a practical implementation of the ideas presented in the framework introduced in [1], and to lay stonger foundations to further work with the idea of abstraction of causal models. The notebook is structured as follows: \n",
    "- Setup of standard and custom libraries (Section 2)\n",
    "- Review of the definition of abstraction and notation (Section 3)\n",
    "- Automated computation of abstraction error given pairs of variables in M1 connected by a directed path in M1 (Section 4)\n",
    "- Automated computation of abstraction error given all pairs of variables in M1 (Section 5)\n",
    "- Automated computation of abstraction error given pairs of variables in M1 connected by a directed path in M0 or M1 (Section 6)\n",
    "- Automated computation of abstraction error given sets of variables in M1 connected by a directed path in M0 or M1 (Section 7)\n",
    "- Integration of the code for the automated computation in the *Abstraction* class (Section 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "DISCLAIMER 1: the notebook refers to ideas from *causality* and *category theory* for which only a quick definition is offered. Useful references for causality are [3,4], while for category theory are [5,6].\n",

    "In this notebook we have automated the procedure for computing the abstraction error between two models related by an abstraction. We have built on a series of examples, each time considering richer evaluation set over which to compute the abstraction error. The final implementation consider all possible disjoint sets of variables in the high-level model and evaluates the abstraction error over them. Meaningful and efficient computation of the abstraction error will depend on the selection of a representative and efficient evaluation set and a meaningful and robust distance metric."
